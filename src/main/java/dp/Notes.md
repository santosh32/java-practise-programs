Creational Patterns, as the name implies, are most concerned about solutions and options revolving around instantiating objects,
and how to do so more efficiently in the most varied of circumstances.

Creational patterns often used in place of direct instantiation with constructors. They make the creation process 
more adaptable and dynamic. In particular, they can provide a great deal of flexibility about which objects are created, 
how those objects are created, and how they are initialized.

Structural Patterns are concerned about providing solutions and efficient standards regarding class compositions and object structures.
Also, they rely on the concept of inheritance and interfaces to allow multiple objects or classes to work together and form a single working whole.

Behavioral Patterns are concerned about providing solutions regarding object interaction - how do they communicate, how are some dependent on others,
and how to segregate them to be both dependent and independent and provide both flexibility and testing capabilities.

Inter-printer

A good example of this pattern would be Google Translate, which interprets the input, and shows us the output in another language.
Another example would be the Java compiler. The compiler interprets Java code and translates it into bytecode that the JVM uses to 
perform operations on the device it runs on.
