Creational Patterns, as the name implies, are most concerned about solutions and options revolving around instantiating objects,
and how to do so more efficiently in the most varied of circumstances.

Structural Patterns are concerned about providing solutions and efficient standards regarding class compositions and object structures.
Also, they rely on the concept of inheritance and interfaces to allow multiple objects or classes to work together and form a single working whole.

Behavioral Patterns are concerned about providing solutions regarding object interaction - how do they communicate, how are some dependent on others,
and how to segregate them to be both dependent and independent and provide both flexibility and testing capabilities.
